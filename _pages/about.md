Hi, I'm a CS senior undergraduate at [School of Information and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). In Fall 2023, I was an exchange student at [University of Berkeley, University](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research interests center on **Data-Driven Approaches to Human-Centered Computing**, aiming to understand and model human behaviors and societal dynamics shaped by technology. I explore these dynamics from multiple angles, including industrial structures and social media, with the goal of contributing to technology that benefits humanity. In ShanghaiTech, I join [ViSeer Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/) supervised by Prof. [Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/), participating in multiple research projects on **HCI**, **Visual Analystics** and **Social Computing**.

I am also an crazy fan on histroy and strategy games like Paradox, enjoying Europa Universalis IV!
