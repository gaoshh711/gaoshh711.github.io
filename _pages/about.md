Hi, I'm a 4th-year CS undergraduate at [School of Information and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). In Fall 2023, I was an exchange student at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research interests focus on **Human-Centered Computing**, with the goal of understanding and modeling human behavior and societal dynamics influenced by technology. I employ a mix of methods, such as interviews and ML, to explore these dynamics from various perspectives, including industrial structures and social media. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to the development of technology that positively impacts society.

At ShanghaiTech, I am a research intern in [ViSeer LAB](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/) supervised by Prof. [Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/), where I actively participate in research projects on **HCI**, **Data Visualization**, and **Social Computing**.

I am also a crazy fan on histroy and strategy games like Paradox, enjoying Europa Universalis IV!
