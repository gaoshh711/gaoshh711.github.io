Hi, I'm a CS senior undergraduate at [School of Information and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). In Fall 2023, I was an exchange student at [University of Berkeley, University](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research interests focus on **Data-driven Approaches to Human-centered Computing**. I aim to understand and model human behaviors and societal dynamics from multiple perspectives, such as industrial structures and social media, ultimately contributing to technologies that benefit humanity. In ShanghaiTech, I join [ViSeer Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/) supervised by Prof. [Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/), participating in multiple research projects on **HCI**, **Visual Analystics** and **Social Computing**.

I am also an crazy fan on histroy and strategy games like Paradox, enjoying Europa Universalis IV!
