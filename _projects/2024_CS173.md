# Abstract

Game reviews play a crucial role in providing feedback to developers during game development. Studies have emphasized the importance of consumer feedback in refining creations. Additionally, developer-audience interactions have been shown to boost consumer confidence and increase product sales. However, developers, especially smaller-scale or individual ones, often face constraints in processing and acting upon this feedback. This paper aims to tackle the question: "Which reviews are most valuable for developers?" We propose utilizing statics methods and developing a recommendation system using data from Steam, a leading platform in the gaming industry.
